# Gameplay Design

Dans le cadre de mon échange Erasmus en Suède, j'ai pu suivre un cours de gameplay design. 
Voici les descriptifs des différents travaux que j'ai pu réaliser.

## Création d'un jeu de plateau

## Définition d'un jeu
The assignment consists of giving a personal definition of what a game is. Besides the definition the text should include motivations for why your definition is phrased exactly as it is. That is, it should describe why some concepts are parts of it and why some concepts are not part of it (the first lecture gives many such concepts which should be discussed). The text should also give examples of games that fit your definition, but more importantantly it should include examples of what others typically call games but that does not fit your definition.

Learning Objectives
The purpose of assignment 1 is that you should:

    Reflect on your personal view on what a game is, and how others may differ in their opinion.
    Write argumentative texts where you take one position with motivations and argue against possible objections.
    Compare games that belong to different categorizes to analyze the common features and differences between genres and mediums of games.


## Analyses de jeux à l'aide d'outils de game design
The assignment consists of analyzing two games: No Thanks! and Catan (also knows as Settlers of Catan). The analysis should show that you can make use of academic concepts as well as model aspects of the games with modelling tools. Specifically, the text should contain:
Answers to the following questions:
What design structures are used to keep players engaged with the game, both regarding interest and regarding actively doing actions?
What design structures are used to make the games typically end near the stated time (given players that know the rules)?
What design structures are used to make players interact with each other, or at least have a feeling that they have been playing a game together?
What design structures exist to make players feel that they are achieving something while they are playing?
Descriptions of the games and their gameplay making use of game mechanics and gameplay design patterns (core gameplay should be covered, the whole games cannot be covered) and relate to the MDA model
Clear explicit use of game mechanics and gameplay design patterns (i.e. mark these with italics, bold, or small caps and state how you mark them - don't use the same marking style for both)
Define patterns and mechanics you have identified as new, use references for those that have been described by others before
Models of both games in i* that showing how players' goals work towards winning states as well as can work against each other (use the creative leaf software and take screendumps for the assignment)
Models of both games in Machinations showing how the game progresses towards an end game state and what feedback loops you can identify (use the machination software and take screendumps for the assignment)
A discussion what you could not capture in the models due to limitations in the tools

Note that the modelling tools do not let you easily model everything about a game, especially aspects regarding each player in a game with many players and how to handle games with many resources. Due to this you need to choose how much to model in relation to what you should model as stated above. As a starting point, assume that your model should include show actions, goals, etc. from one player and all other players may be modelled more abstractly.

Please having the uploaded attachment named using the format: “ID {Group ID in pingpong} Assignment 2" (having it named "Assignment 2" or similar shows that you haven't considered the reader).

Learning Objectives

The purpose of assignment 2 is that you should show that you can:

    Describe gameplay of two games using academic concepts
    Model games with various tools to provide different types of analysis
    Argue how players goals can affect actions and the goals of other players
    Argue how games can be designed to end after a certain number of moves with a good probability
    Give a critical perspective towards the concepts, frameworks, and tools


## Création d'un jeu de plateau

### Game Idea Description 
Having a clear vision and been able to express that vision is vital to successfully completing game projects. The game idea description shows that you can develop (and agree upon) a single concept early on and describe what the unique features are.

The purpose of this assignment is that you should be able to:
Develop a game idea based upon a few game mechanics Explain your game ideas in the form of game mechanics Show your knowledge of a certain type of games (which may mean that you need to learn about that type of games) Express differences in gameplay between your idea and already existing games

### Play test of Low-Fidelity Game Prototype 
Upload an image of your prototype as hand-in for this assignment. This just becasue you need to have uploaded SOMETHING in Ping-Pong, otherwise we can't give feedback and points. A picture is probably the easiest, plus it refreshens our memory.
Your gameply design tests will be assessed according to whether your test is well prepared in terms of:
Having a playabale prototype Knowing what to test Perform the test in a structured way (have at least one facilitator/observer) Have a means to collect information/feedback from the test Activley seeking gameplay testers
And also:
Whether you help other groups by playtesting their games


### Oral Presentation of Game Design Concept 
Your presentations should be ten minutes long and should contain
A description of your game concept in terms of
A brief overview Theme and/or Setting Core gameplay Competitors Unique Selling points Target Audience 
A description of your process in terms of 
Methods used Thoughts behind the Lo-Fi prototype Changes done since brief Especially due to the play test sessions Next steps
For the process give an overview and then focus on the more important steps, e.g. something "big" or interesting that happened suring rpototyping, something unexpected you learned somehow (e.g. in playtesting etc..)

### Written report of Game Design Concept 
Specifically, the report should contain:
A detailed enough description of the game concept that work could start on several different parts in parallell. Describe both core and secondary gameplay in detail (i.e. describe gameplay and rules) Appropriate use of the vocabulary and frameworks presented in the course (i.e. mechanics, game design patterns, MDA models, feedback loops, iStar models, Machinations models) Note how the game concept differs from existing games (in terms of gameplay rather than just theme.) Thematic and Diegetic aspects (characters, story, game world) Sketches or mock-ups of the interface design / game board / cards / whatever components you have Plan for how players should learn the game (tutorial, level design or equivalent) The process used to create the concept (methods used, relation to methods in the course book)    What changes was done to the concept during the development (especially options that were not chosen)

Please having the uploaded attachment named using the format: “Group {Group ID in pingpong} Assignment 3d" (having it named "Assignment 3d" or similar shows that you haven't considered the reader).
Learning Objectives

The purpose of report is that you should be able to:
    Systematically plan all aspects needed in a game concept
    Make detailed description of a game concept
    Plan and describe the design process of developing a concept
    Motivate design decisions through comparing alternatives

## Guidelines for designing for a gameplay style 
The assignment allows you to show your understanding of gameplay design through describing, analyzing and giving guidelines for a specific gameplay style. A gameplay style can be seen as a potential game genre or, more preferably, as a more specific type of activity done in games that can clearly be described independent of the specific games (and without being genres).

Specifically, the text should contain:

    A definition of the gameplay style
    Appropriate use of the vocabulary and frameworks presented in the course
    Examples of games in which the gameplay style can be found from two different genres
    The "Does and Don'ts" for designing a game with the gameplay style (i.e. guidelines)
    Descriptions of how methods from the book should be modified for designing the gameplay style

Please having the uploaded attachment named using the format: “ID {anonymous ID in pingpong} Assignment 4" (having it named "Assignment 4" or similar shows that you haven't considered the reader).
Learning Objectives

The purpose of text is that you should be able to:

    Define a narrow activity within the gameplay of games, a gameplay style, as a seperate area to study indepedent of the other gameplay
    Analyze games to see how a gameplay style can be varied
    Relate general methods about design to specific areas of design, i.e. a gameplay style
    Provide clear guidelines and motivations for these guidelines
    Show a fluency in discussing gameplay through the use of concepts and frameworks presented in the course
