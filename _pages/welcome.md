Thank you for visiting my portfolio! 

I am a French engineer in computer science and applied mathematics. 
I am particularly interested in video games, for which I have a strong interest. 

Unfortunately I have not yet translated this site in english. The presentations of my projects are therefore only available in French.

However, I encourage you to visit my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-cassard) or [my itch.io](https://shaib.itch.io/)(which you will find my personal game development projects also available [here](/unity/)) page which are written in English.

Also I invite you to consult my resume below or to follow [this link](https://cassards.github.io/documents/Resume_Sebastien-CASSARD.pdf#page=1).
